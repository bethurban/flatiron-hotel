# The Flatiron Hotel

This is a hotel reservation app. Users can create an account with the hotel,
check out the hotel's rooms, see what rooms are available for specific dates
and party size, and book rooms. Admins (hotel managers) can view and sort
upcoming reservations, see available rooms based on dates and party size, and
add new rooms to the hotel.

This app is meant to demonstrate the Ruby on Rails framework working with
ActiveRecord, CSS, and various gems.

## Installation

To use this app, clone, run `bundle install`, run `rake db:migrate`, then run
`thin start --ssl`.

Navigate to https://localhost:3000/ to start the app.
