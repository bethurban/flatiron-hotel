2. OmniAuth login

- Address params in User model - don't allow different User creations w/different params from Facebook vs. usual account creation.
- Need to look at splitting :name in Users connected to Facebook account?
  - Allows user.first_name and user.last_name as we've done all throughout
  - OR eliminate first_name and last_name columns and go with user.name everywhere! EASIER

Notes:

Guest show page should only show reservations in the future.

Guests should not be able to reserve rooms for dates in the past.

Booking date dropdown should be accurate for month selected.

"Book this room" button on reserve page should only show if there are available rooms.

Why are rooms showing up twice on reserve page sometimes? Rooms aren't being evaluated properly.

Need to add error messages for all forms (other than create account).

Create template for homepage/logout links, Flatiron Hotel header.

Dry up controllers like whoaaaa - private methods and class methods?
