Still seeing repeats of rooms when looking for available rooms.
 - What's happening:
    In the form on bookings#new, if any of the room's bookings don't overlap with the entered date range,
    that room will be listed.
    Form needs to somehow be update so that if ANY of a room's bookings overlap with @date_range, then the
    room can't be listed.

Booking date dropdown should be accurate for month selected.

"Book this room" button on reserve page should only show if there are available rooms.

Dry up controllers.
