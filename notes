5. Fill out room show pages with details, photos(?)

6. Nested routes

7. OmniAuth login



Notes:

Guest show page should only show reservations in the future.

Guests should not be able to reserve rooms for dates in the past.

"Book this room" button on reserve page should only show if there are available rooms.

Why are rooms showing up twice on reserve page sometimes? Rooms aren't being evaluated properly.
