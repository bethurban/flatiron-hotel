Next:

1. Nested new bookings route
  - '/users/1/bookings/new'

2. OmniAuth login

Notes:

Guest show page should only show reservations in the future.

Guests should not be able to reserve rooms for dates in the past.

Booking date dropdown should be accurate for month selected?

"Book this room" button on reserve page should only show if there are available rooms.

Why are rooms showing up twice on reserve page sometimes? Rooms aren't being evaluated properly.
